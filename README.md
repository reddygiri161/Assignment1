# Web-Scraping-and-Amazon-Reviews-Analysis

This is a Web Scraping project to analyze product reviews in Amazon.com. Once you provide the Product ID and the number of pages of reviews you want to scrape, the best and the worst reviews are identified based on their sentiment scores. They are highlighted in green and red (for positive and negative reviews respectively) and shown in an HTML format. The mean rating for the product and the overall average sentiment score of the product is also revealed.

Before you buy any product on Amazon, get the Product ID and run this code to find out the reviews that would actually interest you! :D 

The code can be found [here.](https://github.com/Surya-Murali/Web-Scraping-and-Amazon-Reviews-Analysis/blob/master/amazon_reviews_scraper.R)

**Note :** 
* The Product ID can be taken from [Amazon's URL](https://github.com/Surya-Murali/Web-Scraping-and-Amazon-Reviews-Analysis/blob/master/Getting_the_ID_from_the_URL.jpg)
* This project becomes extremely useful if the product has 30+ reviews which is more than likely for most products
* The Outputs would look something like [this!](https://github.com/Surya-Murali/Web-Scraping-and-Amazon-Reviews-Analysis/tree/master/Outputs)
